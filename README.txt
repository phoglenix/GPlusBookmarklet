This is a little bookmarklet I created to mimic the "Note in Reader" bookmarklet which sadly died
 with the removal of social from Reader.
Inspiration taken from:
 http://www.techlifeweb.com/2011/08/12/share-googleplus-cross-browser-bookmarklet/

Notes:
It says "You publicly +1'd this" but it is NOT true. It doesn't actually +1 anything. You have to
 actively share things to use it.
The box will not disappear after sharing because I have no way of determining when you're done
 from outside the frame. You'll just have to click Close.
